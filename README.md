# Controlling CSS with JavaScript
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course `Controlling CSS with JavaScript`. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].


_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._
## Instructions
This practice files repository has only one branch, `main`, and all the examples are available on that branch. Each movie in the course has a corresponding folder named for the chapter and movie number. As an example, the folder named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter.
Most movies have a beginning and an end state folders. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` folder contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` folder contains the code as it is at the end of the movie.

## Installing
The exercise files are stand-alone examples in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You do not need any additional software to run them, and you are free to copy the code and use it in your own projects. 

Be advised some of the advanced examples feature cutting-edge JavaScript and CSS methods not widely supported. For these examples, use the latest version of Chrome.
